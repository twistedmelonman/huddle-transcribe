  Turn a finished huddle-transcribe transcript into a synthesized knowledge-base
  note and register it. Use when the user says a transcript is ready, or asks to
  import, read, analyze, review, or index a meeting transcript. Reads the raw
  transcript plus its .meta.json sidecar, attributes generic Speaker N labels,
  writes a note, and updates the KB registry. Not triggered by a request for a
  morning brief or a schedule question — those only read a transcript, they do
  not index one.

# Huddle Review

A transcript is source material. This skill produces the thing that gets read
later: a synthesized note, registered where a future reader will find it.

## Configuration

Settings come from `~/.config/huddle-transcribe/config`, the same file
`huddle-transcribe` reads. Five keys matter here; all are optional.

| Key | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | resolved by the script; ask it, do not guess (see step 1) |
| `KB_ROOT` | the parent directory of `OUTPUT_DIR` |
| `KB_NOTES_DIR` | `$KB_ROOT/topics/meetings` |
| `KB_INDEX` | `$KB_ROOT/INDEX.md` |
| `RELEASE_AUDIO` | `ask`; `auto` releases the audio without asking (see step 6) |

Read the file with the Read tool and match `^KEY=` lines literally. **Never
source it and never pass it to a shell.** It is user-editable text, and the
script deliberately parses rather than sources it so a config file cannot
execute code. Honor that here. A leading `~` arrives literally and means
`$HOME`; expand only that. Take every other value exactly as written.

The script itself honors only `OUTPUT_DIR`. The other four keys are read by
this skill. If a key is absent, use the default in the table — do not invent a
layout, and do not write outside `KB_ROOT`.

If `KB_ROOT` does not resolve to a directory that exists, stop and say so.
Creating a knowledge base is not this skill's job.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve the transcript

Ask the tool rather than reconstructing a filename:

```bash
huddle-transcribe --dry-run <session-id-or-date>
```

It prints `Title:`, `Duration:`, `Source:`, and `Output:` and changes nothing.
`Output:` is the transcript path. With no argument it resolves the most recent
session, which is the common case right after a meeting.

Prefer a **session id** over a date. A date with two recordings silently
resolves to the most recent one.

Then read the `.meta.json` sidecar beside the transcript. It carries the
authoritative `title`, `duration_seconds`, and `session_id`, and sometimes a
`trimmed_note` recording that a tail of the recording was cut. A
`trimmed_note` changes what the duration means — say so in the note.

### 2. Check the transcript is real before spending effort on it

Whisper transcribes silence as a short phrase repeated at intervals — "Thank
you.", "Sigh." — for the full length of the recording. The file looks
plausible and is worthless.

Count distinct non-timestamp lines. A few unique lines spread across many
minutes is silence, not content. **Stop and report it.** Do not write a note,
and do not offer to mark the session reviewed: the audio is the only remaining
copy, and the user may want to re-transcribe or listen to it.

### 3. Read it in full, then attribute the speakers

Labels are `Speaker 1`, `Speaker 2`, … and carry no identity. Two facts from
`docs/plans/speaker-name-attribution.md`, which are easy to get wrong:

- **Numbering is per-meeting.** Diarization assigns labels in order of first
  utterance, so `Speaker 2` in one meeting is a different person in the next.
  Never carry a mapping across transcripts.
- **Frequency does not identify anyone.** Common first names are ordinary
  English words, so counting tokens produces confident nonsense.

Attribute from direct address in the transcript ("thanks, X", "X, can you") and
from who owns the work being described. **State in the note that attribution is
inferred**, and record any name the transcriber consistently misspells, since
that misspelling is what a future search will hit.

Leave a one-line speaker generic rather than guessing. A wrong name is worse
than `Speaker 7`.

### 4. Write the note

One note per meeting, in `KB_NOTES_DIR`. Match the frontmatter of existing
notes in that directory; read one first. A typical shape:

```markdown
---
id: YYYYMMDD-short-slug
title: "Meeting Name — Mon DD YYYY"
tags: [meetings, ...]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
source: ../../transcripts/<transcript filename>
---
```

Take tags **only** from the controlled vocabulary in `KB_INDEX`. Read that list
before choosing; add a new tag to the vocabulary before using it, or use none.

Synthesize. Capture decisions and who made them, root causes, owners, and what
is still open. A reader should not need the transcript afterward. Do not paste
transcript text. Record things that were explicitly deferred, and by whom — a
deferral is a decision.

**If a note for this transcript already exists**, edit it in place and bump
`updated`. Check by searching `KB_NOTES_DIR` for a `source:` line naming this
transcript. Do not create a second note for one meeting.

### 5. Register it

A note nobody can find is not done. In the same change:

1. Add a line to the registry in `KB_INDEX`, matching the surrounding format.
2. Add the note to its topic index (commonly `_topic.md` beside the note).

Both, every time. A KB that requires a full-text scan to find a note has lost
the thing the index was for.

**Never edit `transcripts/_index.md`.** It is generated by `huddle-transcribe`
and carries a header saying so; the next run overwrites any edit. The new
transcript is already listed there.

### 6. Release the audio

```bash
huddle-transcribe --mark-reviewed <session-id>
```

**This deletes the source `.m4a`**: to the Trash where `trash(1)` exists,
otherwise outright. Pass the **session id**, not the date, for the reason in
step 1.

Only after the note exists **and** is registered (step 5). Never after step 2
stopped on a silence transcript: there the audio is the only useful copy.

What happens next depends on `RELEASE_AUDIO`:

- **`ask`, absent, or any other value:** offer it as a question. Say plainly
  that it deletes the audio. Never run it unprompted, never bundle it into
  another step, and never add `--yes` on the user's behalf. If the user
  declines, the transcript and audio both stay. That is a valid end state.
- **`auto`:** the user has already said yes, once, in their own config. Run it
  with `--yes` as the last step, then report the path the script says it
  removed. If the script refuses (a sidecar or session-id guard fails), report
  the refusal as it is. Do not work around it.

## Boundaries

- Read the transcript; never edit it. It is the record of what was said.
- Write only inside `KB_ROOT`.
- Deleting audio requires an explicit yes: every time, or once as
  `RELEASE_AUDIO=auto` in the config. Nothing else counts as a yes.
- If something in the transcript is ambiguous, say so in the note rather than
  resolving it silently. A note that marks its own uncertainty stays useful;
  one that guesses confidently does not.
