# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Three Bash scripts. `huddle-transcribe` wraps MacWhisper Pro's `mw` CLI: it
picks a meeting recording out of MacWhisper's own SQLite database, transcribes
it with speaker diarization, and writes a `.md` transcript plus a
`.meta.json` sidecar. `huddle-watch` drives it from launchd, waking on a
database change and transcribing each session that has newly become ready.
`huddle-migrate-md` is a one-shot: it adopts `.txt` transcripts written
before the Markdown switch by renaming them and repointing their sidecars.

There is no build step and no package manager. The test suite is a single
Bash script, `tests/run-tests.sh`; the rest of the repo is the three scripts,
a README, a LICENSE, and the CI workflows.

## Commands

```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh                          # 237 behavioral tests (some skip off macOS)
shellcheck -S info huddle-transcribe huddle-watch huddle-migrate-md tests/run-tests.sh
shfmt -i 2 -ci -d huddle-transcribe huddle-watch huddle-migrate-md tests/run-tests.sh
shfmt -i 2 -ci -w huddle-transcribe huddle-watch huddle-migrate-md tests/run-tests.sh
```

CI discovers scripts by shebang over git-tracked files, so a new script is
linted automatically once it is committed with an exec bit.

CI runs exactly these. Run the test suite before every commit — the linters
pass on every data-loss bug this repo has had.

`shfmt -i 2 -ci` is the repo's format — plain `shfmt` defaults to tabs and
will rewrite the whole file. Always pass both flags.

`.editorconfig` encodes that same format, and it is load-bearing rather than
decorative. shfmt reads formatting options from it, and the global pre-commit
shell hook applies its own defaults (`-i 2 -ci -bn`) *only* when a repo has no
`.editorconfig`. `-bn` puts binary operators at the start of a continuation
line, which is the opposite of what CI's `shfmt -i 2 -ci` accepts — so without
this file the hook rewrites every `... &&` line ending into a leading `&&` and
CI then rejects it, on a loop no amount of reformatting escapes. Do not delete
it, and keep `binary_next_line = false` in agreement with CI's flags.

**Every extensionless script must be named in `.editorconfig`'s last
section.** The repo's scripts have no `.sh` suffix, so they match neither
`[*]` nor `[*.{sh,bash}]` — only the literal
`[{huddle-transcribe,huddle-watch,huddle-migrate-md}]` list. A script left
out of it gets shfmt's *tab* default, and the failure is quiet in the worst
way: the pre-commit hook reformats the whole file to tabs, reports "All
checked files are clean", and aborts the commit. Nothing says the file was
just rewritten against the repo's style. This is what happened on
`huddle-migrate-md`'s first commit. Add the name here in the same change
that adds the script.

Exercising the script:

```bash
./huddle-transcribe --list       # read-only; lists 10 most recent sessions
./huddle-transcribe --dry-run    # resolves and prints selection, transcribes nothing
```

`--list` and `--dry-run` are the safe paths and the ones to reach for when
verifying a change; `--dry-run` is honored even alongside `--mark-reviewed`.
Any invocation without them runs a real transcription, and `--mark-reviewed`
**removes the source `.m4a`** — never run it to test something.

`tests/run-tests.sh` does exactly this: it builds a synthetic SQLite DB with
the four tables the query touches (`session`, `recordedmeeting`,
`systemaudiorecording`, `mediafile`) plus a stub `mw`, then repoints
`DB`/`MEDIA_DIR`/`MW_BIN`/`CONFIG_FILE` in a copy of the script. Add a case
there for any behavior change; the fixture is cheap to extend.

## Runtime dependencies are not present in every checkout

The script hard-requires `/usr/local/bin/mw` (path is not configurable) and
`~/Library/Application Support/MacWhisper/Database/main.sqlite`. On a machine
without MacWhisper Pro installed, both are missing and the script exits early
with a specific error for each. It also checks for `sqlite3` and `jq` up
front.

The test suite needs none of that. Verify MacWhisper's presence before
claiming a change was tested against real data; otherwise run the suite and
say so. The one thing nothing here covers is the real `mw` binary's flag
handling.

The script deliberately shells out only to POSIX-portable utilities —
notably it does **not** call `date(1)`, because `date -j` is BSD-only and
`date -d` is GNU-only. Date validation is pure bash arithmetic. Keep it that
way so the suite runs on a Linux CI runner.

## Architecture

Single-pass flow, top to bottom: parse args → build the session list from
SQLite → select one session → resolve its audio file → confirm → shell out to
`mw` → write the sidecar.

**`SESSION_QUERY` is the spine.** One SQL string defines a fixed 7-column
row: `session_id, dateCreated, duration, merged_filename,
app_audio_filename, mic_audio_filename, title`. Every selection path
(`--list`, latest, by-date, by-id) runs that same query, and all three
consumers read it with `IFS="$SEP" read -r`. Changing the SELECT list means
updating every one of those readers.

Two properties of that row are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

- **The separator is `$SEP` (0x1F), not a tab.** Tab is IFS whitespace, so
  `IFS=$'\t' read` collapses runs of consecutive tabs and shifts every later
  field whenever a column is empty — the normal case, since a session
  usually has only one of the three media types. Do not "simplify" this
  back to a tab.
- **The title is selected last and scrubbed of tab/CR/LF in SQL.** It is the
  only free-text field, so it sits where a stray control character can only
  truncate the title rather than displace a filename column and send
  `SOURCE_PATH` at a fragment of a name.

Notable details of the query: session IDs are `lower(hex(s.id))` — bare hex,
no dashes, so `find_session_by_id` strips dashes from its argument before
prefix-matching (a UUID copied from MacWhisper's UI is dashed and would
otherwise never match) and rejects anything non-hex. Title and duration are `COALESCE` chains across
`session`, `recordedmeeting`, and `systemaudiorecording`, because MacWhisper
populates different tables depending on how a recording was captured. The
`WHERE` clause filters on `MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` (300) to drop stray short
recordings.

**Audio source preference** is merged multitrack → app/system audio → mic
audio, resolved from the three filename columns after selection.

**Date selection matches the calendar date, not a timestamp distance.**
`find_session_by_date` compares the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of each row's
`dateCreated` against the target. An earlier version anchored the target at
08:00 America/Los_Angeles while parsing rows as UTC and allowed a 16h
half-width window; the mixed zones meant a session stored at 00:30 matched
both that day and the one before. Prefix comparison is exact, needs no
window, and matches what `--list` prints. It re-looks-up the winner via
`find_session_by_id` rather than reusing the row it read; preserve that
indirection.

**The sidecar is the state.** `reviewed` and `deleted_source` live only in
`<basename>.meta.json`; nothing is written back to MacWhisper's database. The
script only ever reads that database. Both the transcript and the sidecar are
written to a temp path beside the target and `mv`d into place, so an
interrupted run cannot clobber a good file — `mktemp` beside the target, not
in `$TMPDIR`, keeps that rename atomic when `OUTPUT_DIR` is on another
volume.

**Output naming** is `YYYY-MM-DD_<slugified-title>_<8-hex-session-id>`. The
id suffix is what keeps two same-day sessions with colliding slugs from
overwriting each other — and, because `--mark-reviewed` finds its sidecar by
that same basename, it is also what stops the delete path from acting on a
different session's sidecar. Do not drop it.

**The extension is `.md`, and that is a delivery constraint, not a taste
call.** Transcripts land in Google Drive, whose web viewer previews Markdown
inline but only offers a download prompt for `.txt`. `mw --format md` differs
from `--format txt` only in wrapping the timestamp and speaker lines in
asterisks (`*00:00-00:06*` rather than `00:06`) — so switching back would
change almost no bytes while breaking the only reason the format was chosen.
The variables are `OUT_DOC`/`DOC_TMP`, deliberately not `OUT_TXT`.

`--end-timestamps` renders start-end ranges instead of a bare start. Do not
use `--format html`: `mw` emits the whole transcript body as a single
unbroken line, which defeats the line-anchored rewrite that
`docs/plans/speaker-name-attribution.md` §5.1 depends on. Apart from the
highlighted timestamp and speaker name, the speaker-label line is byte-identical
across `txt` and `md`, so that plan's anchors are unaffected by this change.

### huddle-watch requires bash 4.2+, and launchd must be told which bash

The script uses `printf '%(...)T'` (bash 4.2+) in `log()`. macOS ships bash
3.2.57 at `/bin/bash` and never updates it, so `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves
to an inadequate interpreter anywhere `PATH` lacks a modern bash — which is
exactly what launchd, cron, and GUI-spawned processes provide. The original
symptom was `printf: \`(': invalid format character` then `ts: unbound
variable`, aborting before a single log line was written: invisible to the
user, invisible to CI (which runs bash 5), and reachable only through launchd.

Three pieces keep that closed, and all three are load-bearing:

- **`ProgramArguments[0]` is an absolute bash, not the script.** When argv[0]
  is an interpreter the kernel never reads the shebang, so launchd's minimal
  `PATH` cannot select the wrong bash. The path is resolved at install time
  from `$BASH` by `resolve_interpreter` — correct on Apple Silicon, Intel, and
  Linuxbrew alike, because `do_install` runs on the target machine and the
  generated plist is untracked machine-local state. Do not hardcode
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`, and do not put an absolute path in the tracked
  shebang; `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is what keeps interactive and CI use portable.
- **The `BASH_VERSINFO` guard at the top** is the backstop for every other
  invocation path. It converts a cryptic mid-run abort into one actionable
  line. Keep it above the first `log()` call.
- **`do_install` boots out before bootstrapping.** `launchctl bootstrap` fails
  when the label is already loaded, and the legacy `load` fallback does not
  replace a loaded job — so a reinstall printed "Loaded" while launchd kept
  running the OLD argv. A plist corrected to name a modern bash therefore went
  on failing. `--status` reports the interpreter the *installed plist* names
  and flags a stale one, which is the check that catches this.

`tests/run-tests.sh` asserts all of it against a real `/bin/bash` 3.2 where
one exists (`skip` on Linux CI, counted separately so it is never mistaken for
coverage that ran). The guard probe uses `--once` with an already-seeded state
file: `--status` never calls `log()`, and a first `--once` returns down the
seeding path before logging, so either would pass against the broken script.

### huddle-watch state

The watcher's own state is one line per session in
`~/.local/state/huddle-transcribe/watch-state`: `<session-id> done` for a
finished session, `<session-id> <n>` for one that has failed `n` times. It is
rewritten via `mktemp` + `mv` beside itself, like every other write in this
repo.

**A first run seeds instead of transcribing.** Otherwise switching the watcher
on re-transcribes the entire backlog. The seeding gate is `[[ ! -s ]]`, not
`-f`: a zero-byte state file is what an interrupted `mv` leaves behind, so it
must be treated as never-seeded rather than as an empty seed.

That gate is why the seeded file always opens with a `#` header line. A first
run that finds nothing ready seeds zero sessions, and without the header it
would leave a zero-byte file — which the `-s` gate then reads as unseeded, so
the next run seeds the first genuinely-ready session as `done` and never
transcribes it, silently. The header keeps a completed seed non-empty while
leaving the gate's meaning intact. Every reader skips `$STATE_COMMENT` lines:
`state_status`, `--status`'s record count, and `--status`'s given-up `awk`.
`state_set` and `--retry` preserve it for free, since both rewrite by
filtering out the lines they are replacing.

## Configuration

`~/.config/huddle-transcribe/config` is *parsed* with `sed`, not sourced —
only a single `OUTPUT_DIR=` line is honored. This is deliberate: the file
cannot execute shell code. Do not "fix" it by switching to `source`.
Precedence is `--output-dir` > config file > the default, a `transcripts/`
folder inside the user's knowledge base (Google Drive–synced; the literal
path is not spelled out here since it embeds the account's Drive email).

## CI

`lint.yml` runs shellcheck, shfmt, an exec-bit check, `--help`, and the
behavioral suite on every PR, with both tools pinned by version and SHA so
CI and local dev agree.

The other three workflows are thin caller stubs for reusable workflows in
`smartwatermelon/github-workflows`. Read the header comment in
`dependabot-auto-merge.yml` before editing it — it documents several things
that must NOT be added to that file (`secrets: inherit`, `actions/checkout`)
and why.

**A PR that touches `.github/workflows/` gets no Claude review.** The skip
fires on *any* file matching `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `*.yaml` — not
only the Claude workflow itself. `claude-code-action` refuses to run against
a PR that can modify the reviewer, so `claude-blocking-review` reports a
green SKIP having reviewed nothing. The step log names the real reason
(`DOC_SKIP_REASON: workflow-self-modification`); the label says
"self-modification" but the match is the whole directory, so a PR editing
only `lint.yml` skips too. An 8-second green `claude-review / run-review` is
the giveaway — a real review cannot finish that fast.

Treat a green blocking-review on a workflow-touching PR as "did not run",
and get the diff reviewed another way — a local adversarial-reviewer pass
over the committed diff is what caught the last round of defects here.
PR #5 is the worked example: it edited only `lint.yml`, went in on a green
SKIP, and a later local pass found two critical defects in it (#13).

The reusable workflows are tracked on floating tags (`@v3`,
`@dependabot-auto-merge-v1`) rather than exact versions, deliberately, so
security fixes arrive without a Dependabot round-trip. See the comment in
`claude-blocking-review.yml` for the incident behind that choice; do not
"harden" it back to an exact pin without reading it first.

## The destructive path

`--mark-reviewed` is the only irreversible operation. It removes the source
audio (via `trash(1)` where available, else `rm -f`) and is fenced by four
checks, each of which exists because its absence was a reproducible
data-loss bug:

1. a sidecar must exist for the resolved session;
2. that sidecar's `session_id` must equal the resolved `$SID`;
3. the transcript must exist and be non-empty;
4. `--dry-run` is honored *before* this block runs.

Check 4 is ordering-sensitive: the `$DRY_RUN` early-exit must stay above the
`--mark-reviewed` block. When it sat below, `--dry-run --mark-reviewed`
deleted the audio.

The sidecar is written only after the audio is confirmed gone, so a failed
removal cannot leave `deleted_source: true` behind.

## huddle-migrate-md

A one-shot that adopts `.txt` transcripts predating the Markdown switch.
It renames each to `.md` and repoints its sidecar's `output_file`. It does
**not** rewrite transcript content: the `txt`/`md` difference is asterisks
around the timestamp line, so an old transcript is already valid Markdown,
and editing the body would mean parsing text this tool has no reason to
parse.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **Survey before mutate.** Every candidate is classified before anything
  is renamed, so the summary the user confirms describes the whole job. A
  migration that prompts once and then hits a blocker halfway has already
  half-migrated the directory.
- **Per pair: build the sidecar temp file, rename the transcript, rename
  the sidecar.** The `jq` step is the fallible one and touches nothing real,
  so it goes first; what remains is two same-directory renames. Note this is
  transcript-before-sidecar, the *opposite* of what
  `docs/plans/speaker-name-attribution.md` §5.4 prescribes — and for the
  opposite reason. There the sidecar is the undo record; here the rename is
  the operation and the sidecar merely names it. A stale sidecar still saying
  `.txt` leaves the full transcript sitting at the `.md`, needing a one-field
  edit; a sidecar naming a `.md` that does not exist strands the pair with
  the transcript no longer reachable through it.
  **Re-running does not repair either state**, and the script must never
  claim it does. The survey globs `*.txt`, so a pair whose transcript already
  moved is not a candidate at all — a re-run prints "Nothing to migrate" and
  exits 0 with the sidecar still stale. An earlier draft asserted the
  opposite in both a code comment and the user-facing error; CI review caught
  it, and `tests/run-tests.sh` now pins the honest message and the fact that
  a re-run leaves the sidecar untouched.
- **Four skip conditions, and a skip never aborts the run.** No sidecar; a
  `.md` already present; an unparseable sidecar; a sidecar naming a
  different file. Each is a case where guessing would lose data.

The sidecar-less case is guarded three times over (the `-f` test, the `jq`
read, and the mismatch comparison against an empty `meta_out`) — verified by
disabling each in turn. That redundancy is deliberate, since this is the
guard whose failure renames a file the tool does not own. It also means the
sidecar-less tests pin the outcome rather than any one branch.

## Known state

`shellcheck -S info`, `shfmt -i 2 -ci -d`, and `bash -n` are all clean, and
CI enforces all three. There are no `# shellcheck disable` directives and
none should be added.
